UC Davis Thesis
UC Davis thesis tempelate based on the ucthesis class: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ucthesis/

Files: 
README        - this file
ucdthesis.cls - the main class file
ucdthesis.bst - natbib compatible bibliography style
thesis.tex    - example thesis
all.bib       - example bibliography
*.tex         - included in thesis.tex

Usage:
I would recommend using ``latexmk'' to typeset the thesis. You can obtain it here:

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk/

You can typeset the example thesis by issuing:

$ latexmk -pdf thesis-simple.tex

Otherwise, you can use

$ pdflatex thesis-simple

An example is included that uses a lot of optional packages. It can be typeset by issuing

$ latexmk -pdf thesis.tex
$ latexmk -pdf -jobname=abstract-standalone thesis.tex

This creates thesis.pdf and abstract-standalone.pdf.
