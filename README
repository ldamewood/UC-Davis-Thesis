UC Davis Thesis
UC Davis thesis tempelate based on the ucthesis class:
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ucthesis/

Files: 
README        - this file
ucdthesis.cls - the main class file
ucdthesis.bst - natbib compatible bibliography style
editor.sty    - adds editing marks to output
samples/thesis.tex    - example thesis
samples/all.bib       - example bibliography
samples/*.tex         - included in thesis.tex

Usage:
I would recommend using ``latexmk'' to typeset the thesis. You can obtain it
here:

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk/

In the samples directory, can typeset the example thesis-simple by issuing:

$ cp ../ucdthesis.cls .
$ latexmk -pdf thesis-simple.tex

Otherwise, you can use

$ cp ../ucdthesis.cls .
$ pdflatex thesis-simple

An example is included that uses a lot of optional packages. It can be typeset
by issuing

$ cp ../ucdthesis.cls .
$ cp ../ucdthesis.bst .
$ cp ../editor.sty .
$ latexmk -pdf thesis.tex
