Thesis template class

Files: 
README        - this file
ucdthesis.cls - the main class file
ucdthesis.bst - natbib compatible bibliography style
thesis.tex    - example thesis
all.bib       - example bibliography
*.tex         - included in thesis.tex

Usage:
I would recommend using ``latexmk'' to typeset the thesis. You can obtain it here:
http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk/

You can typeset the example thesis by issuing:
$ latexmk -pdf thesis.tex

Otherwise, you can use
$ pdflatex thesis

Note: I use a lot of extra packages that come standard on TeXlive. If you use some other TeX distribution, then you may have to do some editing.
